# AI Programming with Python Project

Project code for Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree program. In this project, students first develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.

## File Structure
- `assets` - Folder contains the Flowers.png and inference_example.png
- `Image Classifier Project.ipynb` - Contains all the logic for the image processing model.
- `cat_to_name.json` - Contains all the species of flowers
- `predict.py` - Is the script to run the prediction algorithm
- `train.py` - Is the script to train the model
